    "### What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a way of performing multiple tasks simultaneously within a single program. A thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads within the same process, sharing the same resources and memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python when we want to execute multiple tasks at the same time and when we want to achieve concurrency. For example, a web server that handles multiple client requests simultaneously can use multithreading to handle each request in a separate thread. Multithreading can also be used for other tasks such as file I/O, database access, and graphics rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called \"threading\". This module provides a way to create and manage threads in Python. It includes functions for creating threads, synchronizing threads, and managing thread lifecycles.\n"

    "\n",

    "currentThread() - This function is used to return a reference to the currently executing thread.

    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: With multithreading, an application can continue to respond to user input even while executing time-consuming tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource sharing: Multithreading enables multiple threads to share the same resources such as memory, files, and network connections, which can lead to more efficient use of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Multithreading can help to break down a complex task into smaller, more manageable units of work, which can simplify development and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can make an application more complex and harder to debug and maintain, especially when shared resources are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization: Multithreading requires careful synchronization of shared resources to avoid race conditions and deadlocks, which can be difficult to implement correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading can add overhead to an application, especially if there are many threads, which can affect overall performance.\n",
    "Resource contention: With multiple threads sharing resources, there can be contention for those resources, which can result in reduced performance and potential deadlock."

    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common problems that can occur in concurrent programming, including multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and unable to proceed because they are each waiting for the other to finish. This can happen when two threads are trying to acquire the same resources but in a different order. As a result, each thread ends up holding a resource that the other needs, and they are both stuck waiting for the other to release it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access the same shared resource simultaneously, and the final result depends on the order in which the threads are executed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, as the output of the program can vary depending on the timing and scheduling of the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can be difficult to detect and debug, as they often depend on subtle timing and ordering issues that can be difficult to reproduce consistently. To avoid these issues, it is important to carefully design and test concurrent programs, using techniques such as synchronization and locking to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same shared resources simultaneously."
